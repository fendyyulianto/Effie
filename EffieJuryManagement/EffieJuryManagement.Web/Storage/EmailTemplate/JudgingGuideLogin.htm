                    Dear #NAME#,</p>
                <p>
                    Greetings from APAC Effie and thank you for coming on board as a jury.</p>
                <p>
                    We would like to inform all judges that due to unforeseen circumstances, the dates
                    for Round 1 judging will be pushed back slightly to commence on <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">
                        25 January to 1 February</strong>, instead of 22 to 29 January as communicated
                    earlier. Judges will still have a week period inclusive of weekend to review the
                    entries. We apologize for the change in dates. Do let us know if this may affect
                    your participation in judging and if you might need a bit more time in completing
                    the judging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the Round 1 judging commencing soon, we are also sending some documents for
                    your review and information which we’d request all judges to read through prior
                    to judging. Kindly download the documents via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zdhbu9jtz1ai2u5/AAAySMuVQiGPLv0Yc2L4ODEha?dl=0">
